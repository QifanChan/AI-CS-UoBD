Answer each question in a separate cell below.\n","\n","1. How do you access a specific element in a one-dimensional numpy array?\n","\n","    `array[index]`\n","\n","2. How can you access an element in a two-dimensional numpy array using row and column indices?\n","\n","    `array[row, column]`\n","\n","3. What is slicing in the context of numpy arrays?\n","\n","    To extract the subset of numpy arrays\n","\n","4. How do you extract a subarray from a one-dimensional numpy array using slicing?\n","\n","    `array[start: stop: step]`\n","\n","5. How can you extract a subset of rows or columns from a two-dimensional numpy array?\n","\n","    `array[start: stop: step, start: stop: step]`\n","\n","6. What does the colon `:` symbol represent when slicing numpy arrays?\n","\n","    The `:` alone like `array[:]` represents all elements in that dimension when slicing a numpy array\n","\n","7. How can you reverse the elements of a numpy array using slicing?\n","\n","    `array[::-1]`\n","\n","8. What is the difference between using a single bracket `[]` and double brackets `[[]]` when indexing a two-dimensional numpy array?\n","\n","    `[]` accesses row,\n","    while double brackets `[[]]` can lead to unexpected behavior and is not standard for accessing elements in a two-dimensional numpy array.\n","\n","9. How do you extract specific rows and columns from a matrix using integer array indexing?\n","\n","    `array[row, column]`\n","\n","10. What is boolean indexing in numpy, and how is it used?\n","\n","    It is treat as a mask, it will only return those elements correspond the `True` or `False` condition.\n","\n","11. How can you use boolean indexing to filter out elements that don't meet a certain condition?\n","\n","    `array[array > 5]`\n","\n","12. How do you modify a specific element in a numpy array?\n","\n","    `array[row, column] = new value`\n","\n","13. What happens when you try to access an index that is out of bounds in a numpy array?\n","\n","    Return an error: `IndexError`\n","\n","14. How can you extract a diagonal from a two-dimensional numpy array?\n","\n","    use a nested for loop or `numpy.diag()`\n","\n","15. How do you access the last element of a one-dimensional numpy array?\n","\n","    `array[-1]`\n","\n","16. How can you extract every nth element from a numpy array using slicing?\n","\n","    `array[::n]`\n","\n","17. What is the difference between deep copying and shallow copying in the context of numpy subarrays?\n","\n","    Deep copying will completely copy the original numpy array.\n","    \n","    Shallow copying creates a view of the original numpy array, it is like a pointer points to the address of that numpy array.\n","\n","    In numpy, slicing creates a view (shallow copy), while the numpy.copy() function creates a deep copy.\n","\n","18. How do you create a view of a numpy array without copying the data?\n","\n","    `array[:]`\n","\n","19. How can you reshape a subarray extracted from a larger numpy array?\n","\n","    `array[start:stop].reshape()`\n","\n","20. How do you combine integer indexing and slicing to access elements of a numpy array?\n","\n","    `array[index, start: stop]`\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"id":"b431051d","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":228},"id":"b431051d","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1698699741329,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Hongbo Wei","userId":"03161039960449601963"}},"outputId":"0785f80f-a8c6-467c-e2f4-2a73329d58ae"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[0 2 4 6 8]\n"]},{"output_type":"error","ename":"IndexError","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mIndexError\u001b[0m                                Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-6-e59e75b7ba7f>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 5>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[0marray\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnp\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0marange\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m0\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m10\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m2\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0marray\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 5\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0marray\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m5\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mIndexError\u001b[0m: index 5 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 5"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","array = np.arange(0, 10, 2)\n","print(array)\n","array[5]"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Hmg0lVYRZCN-"},"id":"Hmg0lVYRZCN-","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
