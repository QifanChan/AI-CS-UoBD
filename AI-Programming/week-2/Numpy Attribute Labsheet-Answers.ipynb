The `strides` attribute of a numpy array indicates the number of bytes that should be skipped in memory to move to the next element.\n","13. The `flags` attribute's `C_CONTIGUOUS` (or `C`) and `F_CONTIGUOUS` (or `F`) values can be checked to see if the elements in a numpy array are in contiguous memory.\n","14. The `base` attribute in a numpy array contains the base object if the array is a view (i.e., derived from another array), otherwise it is `None`.\n","15. The `flags` attribute's `WRITEABLE` value can be checked to determine if the memory of a numpy array is writeable.\n","16. The `flags` attribute of a numpy array provides information about memory layout, writeability, and other properties of the array.\n","17. If the `base` attribute of a numpy array is not `None`, then the array is a view of another array.\n","18. The `flags` attribute gives information about the memory layout of the array.\n","19.
